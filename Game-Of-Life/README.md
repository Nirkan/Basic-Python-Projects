### Python Game of Life 


## Rules

- If a cell is alive and has two or three living neighbours, the cell stays alive in the next generation.
- A living cell that has no living neighbours or only one living neighbour dies of isolation in the next generation.
- A living cell that has four or more living neighbours dies from overpopulation in the next generation.
- A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours results in birth and becomes alive in the next generation
